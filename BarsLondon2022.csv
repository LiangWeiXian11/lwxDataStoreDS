2. All figures have been rounded to the nearest 5. Figures may not add exactly due to rounding. Some figures which appear to be zero may not actually be zero.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Workplaces with zero employment and enterprises with zero employment have been excluded from this analysis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. In 2015, the IDBR extended the coverage of businesses to include a population of solely PAYE-based businesses that were",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"previously excluded because of a risk of duplication. At UK level, 105,000 businesses have been added in 2015. A more detailed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5. Data prior to 2009 has been converted from SIC 1992 and SIC 2003 onto SIC 2007 to provide a consistent time series. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"9. Where data has been published before as part of this series it is not revised. As a result, data for each geography reflects all postcodes in that geographical area at that time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10. Figures may differ slightly from those published in the UK Business time-series as they are based on an 'enhanced' version of the IDBR and have slightly different disclosure and rounding rules applied.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
